<P>Welcome to the GCDCollector home page!</P>

<h3>About GCDCollector</h3>

<P>GCDCollector is a program to maintain a database of your personal comic collection.  It is backed by a huge database of comics information that has been gathered over many years by the good folks at the <a href='http://www.comics.org/'>Grand Comic Book Database Project</a> (GCD) and made publicly availble.</p>

<P><i>This project is just getting underway, so there isn’t much here yet. But if you’re interested in helping out, give me a shout.</i></P>

<P>I was unsatisfied with the currently-available commercial solutions for managing a personal comic-book collection, so I set about writing my own software.  That said, if you're looking for a solid (and supported!) comic database software&mdash;and especially given the very early state of this project&mdash;you should definitely try one or both of the following commercial offerings:

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.collectorz.com/comic/'>Collectorz.com (Comic)</a></li>
<li><a href='http://www.comicbase.com/'>ComicBase</a></li>
</ul>

<P>GCDCollector is open-source software, released under a modified BSD license.  For full details, see the <a href='license.html'>license page</a>.</p>
